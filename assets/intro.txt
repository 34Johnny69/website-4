Choo is a framework for people like you and me. Perhaps you're most
comfortable writing HTML and CSS, and would like to add some JavaScript. Or
perhaps you're an industry veteran that wants to create reusable browser
elements. Or maybe you're one of those perf devils. But it's just as likely
you're none of the above. Choo is here to help.
