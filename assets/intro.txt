Choo is a framework for people like you and me. Perhaps you're most
comfortable writing HTML and CSS, and would like to start doing some JavaScript
on top. Or perhaps you're an industry veteran that would like to start creating
reusable elements. Or maybe you care deeply about performance. But it's just as
likely you're none of the above. Choo is for everyone.
